     * filter structure, incorporating four delay lines from the two previous input and
     * output values.
     *  
     * This filter can be used in three ways: as a low-pass filter that attenuates frequencies
     * higher than the <code>frequency</code> property, as a high-pass filter that attenuates frequencies lower
     * than the center, or as a band-pass filter that attenuates frequencies that lie
     * further from the center.  In all three cases the <code>resonance</code> property controls
     * the abruptness of the rolloff as a function of frequency.  The <code>type</code> property
     * determines which filter behavior is used.
